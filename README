5) Development Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This project was the first of CS3600's projects. It is the first time out team
worked together as a team. We started this project early and worked on it sporadically 
throughout the project timeframe. Git was used to version the code. As a result, our team 
was able to work on this project independently, only meeting to work specifically on the 
project at the very beginning. Otherwise, communication happened electronically, between 
classes, and work was done whenever either of the team members had spare cycles. Parts that 
needed to be done where mentioned in the git comments or in a TODO comment in the code. Bugs 
were identified using the test scripts. A wrapper for the test script was developed to isolate 
the tests that were failing and forward those tests into a separate file for further investigation. 
Likewise, corner cases were tested with custom test scripts. 
        Special attention was paid to make sure that the code is stable. Using perl's ability
to generate large inputs and testing corner cases of escape characters and redirection. 
The ability for the program to handle large inputs was tested. Likewise, using top the memory 
footprint of the design was analyzed (3600sh uses about 4x less memory than bash on the CCIS 
machines and this does not change significantly with operation).
        The only extra feature that is currently implemented in 3600sh is the ability to support 
cd. This was added because it added because it added a high level of extra functionality 
with little overhead.
